# branch.sh — Branch-base git operations.
#
# Single source of truth for "where did this branch diverge from main" plus
# the operations that need that base: diff, log, and files.
#
# Use:
#   bash scripts/branch.sh base                      # print resolved BASE
#   bash scripts/branch.sh diff <path> [<path>...]   # git diff BASE..HEAD -- paths
#   bash scripts/branch.sh log [git-log-flags]       # git log --oneline BASE..HEAD
#   bash scripts/branch.sh files [filter] [--uncommitted-only]
#
# `files` prints a sort-unique list of paths changed on the branch — the branch
# diff (BASE..HEAD) unioned with uncommitted work (staged, unstaged, untracked)
# — one path per line, no headers. Filters narrow the list:
#   --rust          *.rs
#   --frontend      *.ts / *.tsx, excluding e2e/
#   --arch          *.rs / *.ts / *.tsx, excluding e2e/
#   --e2e           e2e/**/*.test.ts
#   --migrations    migrations/*
#   --security      *.rs / *.ts / *.tsx OR capabilities/**/*.json
# `--uncommitted-only` drops the branch-diff source (in-flight files only). A
# filter and --uncommitted-only compose, in either order.
#
# Output: stdout-only. base prints a sha-or-sentinel; diff/log/files forward
# the underlying git output verbatim. Never fails on base resolution — falls
# back through merge-base → rev-parse → "HEAD" so detached HEAD / shallow clone
# / missing-main branches still get a usable BASE.
#
# Exit codes: 0 on success; 2 on a usage error (unknown subcommand/flag, or
# `diff` with no paths). Underlying git failures propagate their own status.
#
# Why a script (vs inline shell in agent prompts):
#   Compound shell ($(...), &&, ||, ;) cannot be safely allowlisted in
#   Claude Code's permission system, which matches by literal prefix. A
#   literal `bash scripts/branch.sh diff foo.ts` call IS allowlistable as
#   `Bash(bash scripts/branch.sh *)`. One entry covers every consumer — and
#   the named `files` filters keep reviewer prompts pipe-free for the same
#   reason (`branch.sh files | grep ...` would prompt on every distinct shape).
