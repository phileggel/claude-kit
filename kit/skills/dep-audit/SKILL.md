# Skill — `dep-audit`

Audit npm and Cargo dependencies for outdated versions and known CVEs.
Uses **live web search** to verify real-world versions — never relies on model knowledge alone.

---

## Required tools

This skill requires: `Bash`, `Read`, `WebSearch`.

**Before starting**: verify that `WebSearch` is available. If it is not, stop and inform the user — without web search, version data would come from stale model knowledge and cannot be trusted.

---

## When to use

- **Before every release** — CVEs are a release blocker
- **Start of a work session** (optional) — surface version drift early
- **After a batch of dependency changes** — confirm no new vulnerabilities introduced

---

## Placement rules (applies always, no tools needed)

| Finding                              | Rule                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build-time package in `dependencies` | 🟡 Move to `devDependencies` (bundlers, linters, type checkers, test runners, type definitions) |
| Runtime package in `devDependencies` | 🟡 Move to `dependencies` (UI libs, state managers, utilities imported in `src/`)               |
| Test-only crate in `[dependencies]`  | 🟡 Move to `[dev-dependencies]`                                                                 |
| Two packages serving the same role   | 🟡 Keep one, remove the other                                                                   |

## Execution Steps

### 1. Read declared dependencies

Read `package.json`. Locate `Cargo.toml` by reading `ARCHITECTURE.md` or by searching for `Cargo.toml` in the project root and one level of subdirectories; skip Cargo checks if not found. Extract all declared packages and their version ranges.

### 2. Get current toolchain version

```bash
rustc --version
```

### 3. Run local audit tools

Run the following — failures are expected if tools are not installed and must appear in the report under "Tool availability":

```bash
npm outdated 2>/dev/null || true
npm audit 2>/dev/null || true
```

```bash
# Run from the directory containing Cargo.toml (discovered in Step 1)
cargo outdated 2>/dev/null || echo "(cargo-outdated not installed)"
cargo audit 2>/dev/null || echo "(cargo-audit not installed)"
```

If `cargo-outdated` or `cargo-audit` are missing, flag them in the report: `⚠️ {tool} not installed — install with: cargo install {tool}`

### 4. Web-verify all reported issues

**CRITICAL**: Never report a version as "latest" or "outdated" based solely on model knowledge — it may be months out of date. For every package flagged as outdated, use WebSearch to confirm the actual current version and cite the source URL.

Always verify:

- **Rust stable**: search `rust stable release latest site:blog.rust-lang.org`
- **Tauri**: search `tauri-apps tauri latest release github`
- **npm packages**: search `{package} npm latest version` or check npmjs.com
- **Cargo crates**: search `{crate} crates.io latest version`
- **CVEs**: search `{package} security advisory CVE 2025` or check osv.dev

### 5. Classify findings

| Severity       | Criteria                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 CVE         | `npm audit`: severity `moderate`/`high`/`critical`. `cargo audit`: any advisory. **Release blocker.** |
| 🟡 Major drift | Latest major > current major (e.g. v5 in use, v6 available)                                           |
| 🟡 Misplaced   | See placement rules above                                                                             |
| 🔵 Minor drift | Latest minor > current minor within same major                                                        |

**Release vs. non-release context:**

- In **release context**: 🔴 CVEs are hard blockers — do not proceed to tag/publish without fixing.
- In **non-release context**: 🔴 CVEs are flagged urgently but do not block the current session — inform the user and recommend scheduling a fix.

### 6. Report

Get today's date (`date +%Y-%m-%d`) for the report heading.

```
## Dependency Audit — {date}

### Tool availability
⚠️ cargo-outdated not installed — install with: cargo install cargo-outdated
⚠️ cargo-audit not installed — install with: cargo install cargo-audit
(omit this section if all tools are available)

### npm (`package.json`)
🔴 CVE: {package} {version} — {severity} — {advisory ID} — {description}
     Fix: npm audit fix (or manual bump to {fixed-version}, source: {url})
🟡 Major drift: {package} {current} → {latest} (source: {url})
🟡 Misplaced: {package} in {wrong-section} — should be in {correct-section}
🔵 Minor drift: {package} {current} → {latest} (source: {url})

### Cargo (`Cargo.toml`)
🔴 CVE: {crate} {version} — {advisory} — {description}
🟡 Major drift: {crate} {current} → {latest} (source: {url})
🔵 Minor drift: {crate} {current} → {latest} (source: {url})

### Rust toolchain
Installed: {output of rustc --version}
Stable:    {version from web — cite source URL}
Status: ✅ up to date / 🟡 behind (update with: rustup update stable)

### Summary
🔴 {N} CVE(s) — must fix before release
🟡 {N} major drift(s) / misplaced dep(s)
🔵 {N} minor drift(s)
```

If all clean: `✅ All dependencies up to date and no known CVEs.`

## Critical Rules

1. **Always use WebSearch to verify versions** — never report stale model knowledge as fact
2. **Always cite the source URL** next to any version number you report
3. 🔴 CVEs are a **release blocker** — do not proceed to tag/publish without fixing
4. Missing tools (`cargo-audit`, `cargo-outdated`) must be flagged in the report, not silently skipped
5. Report `misplaced` deps even if versions are current — placement affects production bundle size

---

## Notes

Web search is mandatory because model training data can be months behind the actual package ecosystem. A missed CVE or a falsely "current" version is worse than not running the audit at all. The skill is designed to be trustworthy, not fast.
